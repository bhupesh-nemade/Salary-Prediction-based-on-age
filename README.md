# 💼 Salary Prediction Based on Age

This project predicts an individual's salary based on their age using a machine learning model. It includes a trained model and a Streamlit web application for user interaction.


## 📁 Project Structure

- `app.py`: Streamlit application script to interact with the salary prediction model.
- `app.py.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook version of the Streamlit app for exploratory purposes.
- `salary_model.pkl`: Serialized (pickled) machine learning model trained to predict salary based on age.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bhupesh-nemade/Salary-Prediction-based-on-age.git
   cd Salary-Prediction-based-on-age
Install required packages:

It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
Then install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: If requirements.txt is not present, you can install the necessary packages manually:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn
📊 Usage
Run the Streamlit application:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
Interact with the app:

Enter an age value in the input field.

Click the "Predict" button.

The app will display the predicted salary based on the input age.
